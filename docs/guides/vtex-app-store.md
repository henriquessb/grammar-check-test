The [VTEX App Store](https://apps.vtex.com/) is a marketplace for VTEX IO plug-and-play solutions. It is where both first-party and third-party apps are published to be downloaded by clients and partners.

Developers that want to publish their solutions in the VTEX App Store have to follow a series of procedures which are detailed in the cards below.

> For an app to be eligible for publication in the App Store, it must be [public](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-10-making-your-app-publicly-available) â€“ meaning it should be available for all VTEX accounts to install or purchase. In technical terms, this translates to having a [billing model set up for the app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-setting-your-apps-billing-model#setting-the-app-as-public).

Every app in the VTEX App Store must go through the [homologation process](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-submitting-your-app-in-the-vtex-app-store#step-3-waiting-for-the-app-homologation) before being are published to the App Store, independently from the type of functionality (storefront, admin, backend, pixel). In this process, our team assesses if the app follows our [guidelines](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-homologation-requirements-for-vtex-app-store). The homologation process must occur for new apps and new major versions of apps (e.g., when updating an app version from `1.x` to `2.x`).
